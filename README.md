# neetcode-solutions

After cracking Leetcode (check out my repo on https://github.com/DanielHara/leetcode-solutions), now I'm getting started with Neetcode!
(https://neetcode.io/practice). I'm starting with learning Machine Learning seriously, so I'm starting a course privately with a tutor!

If you're a fan of Leetcode like me, be sure also to check out Neetcode: https://neetcode.io/

I'll post my solutions to the questions I solve here!
